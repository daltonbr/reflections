* How did viweing a diff between two version help you spot the bug?
It help us to narrow the search, and by consequence we spend less time with debugging code.

* How could having easy acess to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It help us in case of some data loss. Like a failure in a storage system.
Also we can compare, and when needed, we can rollback some parts of older version of our codes.
