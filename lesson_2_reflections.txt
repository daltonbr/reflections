1- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
ALREADY answered

2- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
ALREADY answered

3- How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
We can add to staging area just the files that have the logical change that we made.
We can also keep the others changes in the working directory also, and we don't add it to the staging area until we commit this first change.
